# sql-zoo

Project: [SQL Zoo - Databases Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/databases-sql-zoo)

Introduction:

We are going to do the tutorials from SQL Zoo.

SQL Zoo is one of the few resources online that actually lets you build and run queries against existing tables. Each tutorial will show you a table and then have you run queries against it to answer specific questions.

Assignment:

Go to [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial) and do Tutorials 0-9 listed under the “Tutorial Section” and the quizzes listed at the end of each. Make sure to select MySQL on the SQL Engine.

Goal: 

This project aims to implement all that we learned from the previous resources/lessons from [Databases](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/databases) and [Databases and SQL](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/databases-databases-and-sql).
